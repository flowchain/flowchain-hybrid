The fast and light-weight Flowchain hybrid consensus miner.

# Introduction

The `flowchain-hybrid` is a fast and light-weight Flowchain hybrid node that can mine FlowchainCoin. It is the *hybrid consensus node* across the Flowchain hybrid blockchain network that connects to the public blockchain and provides the puzzle and `Î»` values to the private blockchains.

Flowchain aims to implement a blockchain that can provide a distributed ledger technology for the IoT and AI. Flowchain already proposed the virtual blocks technology that can ensure chunked data (data streams) transactions in a near-instant manner. Furthermore, the virtual block technology can integrate with IPFS, an emerging distributed storage blockchain and can work as an off-chain mechanism to transfer your digital assets from one trusted party to another. Flowchain shows the implementation of a distributed storage using Flowchain and IPFS open source technologies.

In the Flowchain network, hybrid node (aka. edge node) miners can join the Flowchain mining pool to broadcast puzzles to IoT devices. The flowchain-hybrid app is built upon [flowchain-ledger](https://github.com/flowchain/flowchain-ledger), the distributed ledger technloogy by Flowchain. Please read [Flowchain](https://flowchain.co) for more information.

# Prerequisite

# How to Use

## Use Flowchain testnet

Start the ```index.js``` Flowchain node:

```
$ node index.js
[Verbose 15:02:10] P2P/Chord/node id = 69a3e9ec2138e70f78abeeb964d50b9512b7e959
[Verbose 15:02:10] P2P/Chord/successor = {"address":"localhost","port":8000,"id":"69a3e9ec2138e70f78abeeb964d50b9512b7e959"}

[Verbose 15:02:11] flowchain-hybrid 0.2.0/----- Start mining -----
[flowchain 15:02:11] Connect to testnet.pool.flowchain.io:3333
[Flowchain/IPFS 15:02:11] Hybrid
[flowchain 15:02:11] Hybrid node API server started on
[flowchain-hybrid 0.2.0 15:02:11] node is running at ws://localhost:8000
[flowchain 15:02:11] Connected to server
[Verbose 15:02:13] P2P/Debug/onNewThing: [object Object]

[P2P/Chord 15:02:13] successor_ttl = 6
[P2P/Chord 15:02:15] predecessor_ttl = 6
```

Use the Stratum protocol ```eth_getWork``` to get the lambda value. The simplest way to do it is using ```curl```:

```
$ curl -X POST -d '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getWork"}' http://localhost:55752/0x0/jollen
```

The response:

```
{"lambda":"5af90b68f9051a6fe1b5a2006cc345dbeafbf9df5d4ae8cc6399f515b51bdb19","puzzle":{"q1":["f","f","f","f"],"q2":["0","0","0","0"]}}
```

The response message indicates that the lambda value is ```5af90b68f9051a6fe1b5a2006cc345dbeafbf9df5d4ae8cc6399f515b51bdb19```, meaning that the entities has to solve the puzzle by this value in a fixed time interval. In short, the entity will receive *Puzzle* from peers, and the Puzzle has 8 to 10 shared works from the Ethereum pool.

## Configuration

The system configurations consist of 4 environment variables:

* `PROXY_PORT` (Default: 8800): The web proxy server port number which *will be removed* in the coming version.
* `REST_PORT` (Default: 8100): The REST APIs of the hybrid node which will be programmable in the coming version by using Flowchain SDK.
* `API_PORT` (Default: 55752): The port number of the mining server.
* `PORT` (Default: 9000): The port number of the p2p node.

```
export PROXY_PORT=9800
export REST_PORT=9100
export API_PORT=55753
export PORT=9000
```

## Block Rewards

Please update the wallet address of the miner in `index.js` and [Sign and Validating Miner Address](https://github.com/flowchain/crypto-night/wiki/TestNet-User-Guide) in order to receive block rewards.

```
var miner = new Miner({
  // Use Flowchain testnet
  servers: [
    {
      id: 0,
      host: "testnet.pool.flowchain.io",
      port: process.env.POOL_PORT || 3333
    }
  ],
  apiServer: {
    host: process.env.API_HOST || '127.0.0.1',
    port: process.env.API_PORT || '55752'
  },
  // the server id to use    
  serverId: 0,
  worker: "flowchain-testnet",
  miner: '[PLEASE PUT YOUR SIGNED MINER ADDRESS HERE]'
});
```

# API Reference

# Roadmap

Flowchain team is working on the "v1.0" public beta which we will launch along with the Flowchain public testnet. During the v1.0 development, the Flowchain project will open source by five stages.

* v0.2: functional tests, implementation to the proposed architecture and virtual blocks technique
* v0.4: specs and protocols v1.0
* v0.6: security auditing and code-refactor
* v0.8: performance improvements
* v1.0: prepare for the main net
